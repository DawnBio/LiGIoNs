# LiGIoNs
LiGIoNs is a profile Hidden Markov Model (pHMM) based method capable of predicting Ligand-Gated Ion Channels (LGICs). The method consists of a library of 10 pHMMs, each corresponding to a single LGIC subfamily. In addition, 14 Pfam pHMMs are used to further annotate and correctly classify unknown protein sequences into one of the 10 LGIC subfamilies.

# Description
This repository contains a python script PredictLGIC.py and the necessary files to run LiGIoNs locally, a python script profileMaker.py that can be used to create the pHMMs and the predicted LGICs that resulted from the application of LiGIoNs on all UniProtKB reference proteomes (proteome_predicted_LGICs.gz).
